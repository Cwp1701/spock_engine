# Spock

spock is a game engine being developed for a game called synther

Current feature list:
- simple UI system, which currently includes button and text
- simple physics world, using box2d
- basic window handling and manipulation

the game engine currently has no central API nor will ever have one
all functions and interfaces will/could/can change with any pull request

Spock engine's "primary feature" is being able to create rigidbodies with tile
like shapes. Like cosmoteer, or like rimworld's tile world. Each rigidbody has
its own "tilemap"
