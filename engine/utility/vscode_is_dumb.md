# VSCODE IS DUMB

you may see that some files are appended with '_'
now why you may be asking yourself??

because vscode's C++ debugger (sometype of GDB intergration)
will try and guess which file it should show when debugging in project that
has files with the same name [even though they are in seperate folders]
its dumb as fuck, and is a bug, but who cares im still gonna use vscode
